### Well hello there ğŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working mostly on mods for unity games
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of c#
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment :/
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about making mods, and you might get a reply
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Contact me on discord at JJoe#4865
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love linux, but I'm stuck in Windows.
